"""Headless entry point: the same background work the Streamlit app starts, without the page.

Run by systemd on the server (klsh-worker@wnt-nolive-bot). It waits until it holds the worker
lease, then runs the loops. SIGTERM gives the lease back and exits 0. If another place takes the
lease, the process exits with code 3 and systemd starts it again (it then waits).
