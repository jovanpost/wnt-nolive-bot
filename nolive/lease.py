"""One running worker per bot, enforced by the database.

Why: the same bot must never run in two places at once (Streamlit Cloud and the server). Two workers
would mean two Telegram listeners and a race on every order. A worker takes the lease at start and
renews it every RENEW_S seconds. Another place can take it only after the holder has been silent
for STALE_S seconds.

Three states matter to the rest of the bot:
  running()    loops and the Telegram listener may run here (we hold the lease, or no lease is in
               use at all: scripts and tests)
  may_trade()  a NEW order may be sent right now. False when the lease is not ours, and also when
               we could not renew it for SAFE_S seconds (database unreachable): by then another
               place may be about to take over, so we stop sending until a renew works again.
  lost         another place holds the lease. Final for this process.

Cancels are never blocked by the lease. Only new orders and loop ticks are.

Same rules as klsh-engine/engine/core/lease.py. This copy adds renew() (a renew can never take the
lease back from someone else), the gate, and a SQLite path for local tests. Works through
Supabase's pooler (plain rows, no session locks). No imports from this package on purpose.
